# ðŸš€ Text Detection and Recognition using EasyOCR | Python + OpenCV

In this repository, youâ€™ll learn how to extract and detect text from any image using **EasyOCR** and **OpenCV** in Python.  
This project randomly selects an image from a folder, processes it with EasyOCR, and visualizes the detected text by drawing bounding boxes and displaying the recognized words directly on the image.  

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn
âœ… How to use **EasyOCR** for text extraction  
âœ… How to draw bounding boxes around detected text  
âœ… How to visualize OCR results using **Matplotlib**  
âœ… How to work with images dynamically using **Python and OpenCV**

This project is perfect for beginners exploring **Computer Vision**, **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**, and **Python automation**.
